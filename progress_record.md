1. Finish testing the bilipschitz embedding for $ \theta(x) $ as square root of xx*, 
with respect to $ D(x,y)=min||x-yU|| $ (done)
2. Execute adversarial attack(done)
3. Get familiar with the code, fine-tune parameter for bilipschitz model

4. rewrite my report into more professional form
5. implement adversarial attack towards original model
6. implement adversarial attack towards bilipschitz model
