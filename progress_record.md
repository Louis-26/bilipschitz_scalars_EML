1. Finish testing the bilipschitz embedding for $ \theta(x) $ as square root of xx*, with respect to $ D(x,y)=min||x-yU|| $ (done)
2. Execute adversarial attack
3. rewrite my report into more professional form

4. familiarize about the code, fine-tune parameter for bilipschitz model
5. implement adversarial attack towards original model
6. implement adversarial attack towards bilipschitz model
